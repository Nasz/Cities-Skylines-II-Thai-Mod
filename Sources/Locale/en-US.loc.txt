EconomyPanel.TAX_AREA_DESCRIPTION[Residential] = Residential taxes are collected from citizens' monthly wages.\r\n\r\nTax rates can be set individually based on each citizen education level.\r\n\r\nLow taxes encourage citizens to move into the city. Lower taxes also help residential buildings level up faster, since more money is left over after upkeep expenses are paid.\r\n\r\nHigher taxes bring more money into the city’s treasury, but can drive away the citizens not willing to pay as much. Higher taxes also slow down residential building level ups, as there is less money left for improvement after expenses are paid. 
EconomyPanel.TAX_AREA_DESCRIPTION[Commercial] = Commercial taxes are collected from companies' monthly profits.\r\n\r\nTax rates can be set individually based on the different types of goods sold.\r\n\r\nLow taxes increase companies' chances of becoming financially successful.

EconomyPanel.TAX_RANGE = {MIN} – {MAX} %
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM[Taxes] = Taxes
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM_DESCRIPTION[Taxes] = Taxes are collected from households and companies.\r\n\r\nResidential taxes are based on monthly wages. Company taxes are based on monthly profits.\r\n\r\nLow taxes encourage new citizens to move into the city, and increase companies' chances of becoming successful. Low taxes also help buildings level up faster, as more money is left over after the building upkeep expenses are paid. \r\n\r\nHigh taxes bring in more money for the city, but can drive away citizens, and they cut into companies' profits. High taxes also make building leveling up slower, since there is less cash left after paying for upkeep expenses.
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM[Fees] = Service Fees
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM_DESCRIPTION[Fees] = Fees are paid by households and companies in exchange for using various services such as education, healthcare, and utilities.\r\n\r\nHouseholds and companies adjust their service usage based on how high the fees are. While lower fees increase well-being in the city, they may not be enough to cover the service’s operating cost entirely. This leaves the city to pay for the rest.
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM[Exports] = Service Trade
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM_DESCRIPTION[Exports] = Surplus from city services can be traded with surrounding cities in exchange for additional income.\r\n\r\nFor example, visitors can use the city’s healthcare services, and vacancies in schools can get filled by students from other cities. Surplus fresh water and sewage treatment capacity as well as excess electricity are automatically sold to surrounding cities as long as the proper utilities connections have been built (pipes for water and sewage, power lines for electricity). 
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM[Government] = Government Subsidies
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM_DESCRIPTION[Government] = The government automatically grants the city subsidies depending in its economic situation. A small city in an overall weak financial situation with poor tax revenue and low service fees receives a fair amount of subsidies, while a larger city in a good financial situation with high revenue stream receives only negligible to no subsidies.
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM[Subsidies] = Subsidies
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM_DESCRIPTION[Subsidies] = Households and companies will receive city subsidies when their tax rates are set in the negative. This will give them a financial boost and exempt them from paying tax. With subsidies, households have more money to level up their building after paying for expenses. Subsidized companies have higher profit margins, and thus they are also able to spend more money on leveling up their businesses.\r\n\r\nSubsidies can be set on the **Taxation** tab, and they are adjustable based on citizen education levels for households and material and immaterial goods manufactured and sold for companies.
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM[Upkeeps] = Service Upkeeps
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM_DESCRIPTION[Upkeeps] = Service upkeep costs consist of the service building’s operating costs (building maintenance and resources used to provide its service such as fuel for a power plant) and the wages of its employees.\r\n\r\nService buildings only provide the amount of each service required by the city at any given time, up to their maximum capacity. Accordingly, they only employ the required number of employees at all times. \r\n\r\nTo save on operating costs, it is possible to lower the quality of a service on the **Services** tab. This decreases the number of employees hired, but will also lead to poorer performance. For example, waiting times for ambulances will be longer, and police and fire departments will have increased response times due to short-staffing.
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM[Imports] = Service Trade
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM_DESCRIPTION[Imports] = Certain services can be imported from surrounding cities. These include education, electricity, water and sewage, police and fire services, road maintenance, healthcare services and garbage services.\r\n\r\nImported services cost the city more than having them provided locally, but importing may be useful when the city is low on space, for example. The overall cost of an imported service is determined by actual usage amounts.
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM[Loan Interest] = Loan Interest
EconomyPanel.BUDGET_ITEM_DESCRIPTION[Loan Interest] = If the city takes a loan, it needs to pay monthly interest based on the loaned amount.\r\n\r\nWhenever a new loan is taken, it is combined into any existing loan, and the monthly interest is calculated based on the combined total. Loan interest is a monthly running cost and does not reduce the loaned amount. Loans can be taken and paid back on the **Loans** tab.

Maps.MAP_DESCRIPTION[River Valley] = Two colossal mountain ranges create a natural border from two sides, while providing ample flat space for building between them. A large, meandering river flows in the middle of the map joined by a few smaller brooks from the mountains. Train tracks run across the entire area, making it easy to tap into the existing railway network for quick outside access.
Maps.MAP_TITLE[Plains] = Sweeping Plains
Maps.MAP_DESCRIPTION[Plains] = The vast ocean can be accessed from multiple smooth beaches nestled between rising cliffs. Opposite the ocean, a long and tall mountain range creates a marvelous landscape. A broad expanse of flat land provides plenty of buildable space between the ocean and the mountains. A single highway runs through the entire length of the map.
Maps.MAP_TITLE[Barrier Island] = Barrier Island
